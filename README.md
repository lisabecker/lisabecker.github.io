# Lisa's personal homepage
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The aim of this project is to establish an internet presence for me.
It consists of two parts:
- Graphical interface homepage www.lisabecker.github.io
- Terminal-style homepage www.lisabecker.github.io/terminal/index.html
You can easily switch from one style of homepage to the other by clicking on
a button (graphical interface homepage) or typing a command (terminal-style homepage).

Both homepages contain links to LinkedIn, GitHub, a PDF of my resume, and my public speaking engagements.
Further, it contains sections where you can read a brief description about me,
my education, and my work experience.

The homepage is hosted on GitHub pages.

### Graphical Interface homepage
This homepage is inspired by Linktree, being very minimal and containing links
to the most relevant profiles.

### Terminal-style homepage:
