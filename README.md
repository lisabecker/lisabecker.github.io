# Lisa's personal homepage
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The aim of this project is to establish an internet presence for myself.
It consists of two parts:
- Graphical interface homepage: www.lisabecker.github.io
- Terminal-style homepage: www.lisabecker.github.io/terminal/index.html
You can easily switch from one style of homepage to the other by clicking on
the button "Terminal Website" (graphical interface homepage) or typing the command "homepage" (terminal-style homepage).

Both homepages contain links to LinkedIn, GitHub, a PDF of my resume, and my public speaking engagements.

Further, it contains sections where you can read a brief description about me, my education, and my work experience.

The homepage is hosted on GitHub pages. It works on all tested devices but is not optimized on anything that's not a browser.

### Graphical Interface homepage
This homepage is inspired by Linktree, being very minimal and containing links to the most relevant profiles (E-Mail, GitHub, LinkedIn). There are three tabs "About", "Education" and "Work Experience" which expand and collapse when you click on the corresponding button.

### Terminal-style homepage:
This homepage is inspired by the unix terminal. You can type and execute commands. By opening, the homepage shows a header welcoming the user and asking them to execute the command "help" to show a list of available commands. By typing certain commands (e.g. "github", "linkedin",...), the respective homepage is opened in a new tab. Other commands (e.g. "about") print the text in the terminal.

### To Do's:
This project will be expanded in the future. The following features are still to be implemented:

- Graphical interface homepage: Create my own background image (showing items that reflect my personality and work)
- Terminal-style homepage: Add command "mailto" for sending emails to me
- Terminal-style homepage: Optimization for mobile devices (auto-scaling for better readability on vertical screens)
- Terminal-style homepage: Edit command "clear" to not clear the header
- Terminal-style homepage: Add command "image" to print my profile picture in the terminal
- Terminal-style homepage: Implement easter egg command(s)
